## What it is

*The Invisible Gravity* is a psychological narrative about relationships that felt
inevitable, consuming, and impossible to leave — even when they were hurting you.

It does not explain *what* happened.

It explains **why it could not have happened any other way**.

Rather than focusing on narcissism as a personality flaw or moral failure, the book
reveals the **structural gravity** created when two nervous systems form a perfectly
balanced — but asymmetrical — system.

A system that works.
A system that costs.

## Why it matters

Many readers arrive at this book asking:

> *“Was I the problem?”*

Most explanations answer by pointing fingers — at the narcissist, at trauma,
or at the reader’s supposed blindness.

This book does something else.

It shows how:
- extreme attraction can be a signal of structural fit, not health  
- balance can exist while harm accumulates on only one side  
- empathy can function as a survival role, not a flaw  
- leaving can feel worse than staying — even when staying is destructive  

For readers trapped in self-blame or endless analysis, *The Invisible Gravity*
offers a language that **ends the search** and redirects energy back to life.
